## Thuộc tính blockchain

- `blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)`: hash of the given block when blocknumber is one of the 256 most recent blocks; otherwise returns zero
- `blobhash(uint index) returns (bytes32)`: versioned hash of the index-th blob associated with the current transaction. A versioned hash consists of a single byte representing the version (currently 0x01), followed by the last 31 bytes of the SHA256 hash of the KZG commitment (EIP-4844).
- `block.basefee (uint)`: current block’s base fee (EIP-3198 and EIP-1559)
- `block.blobbasefee (uint)`: current block’s blob base fee (EIP-7516 and EIP-4844)
- `block.chainid (uint)`: current chain id
- `block.coinbase (address payable)`: current block miner’s address
- `block.difficulty (uint)`: current block difficulty (EVM < Paris). For other EVM versions it behaves as a deprecated alias for block.prevrandao (EIP-4399 )
- `block.gaslimit (uint)`: current block gaslimit
- `block.number (uint)`: current block number
- `block.prevrandao (uint)`: random number provided by the beacon chain (EVM >= Paris)
- `block.timestamp (uint)`: current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch
- `gasleft() returns (uint256)`: remaining gas
- `msg.data (bytes calldata)`: complete calldata
- `msg.sender (address)`: sender of the message (current call)
- `msg.sig (bytes4)`: first four bytes of the calldata (i.e. function identifier)
- `msg.value (uint)`: number of wei sent with the message
- `tx.gasprice (uint)`: gas price of the transaction
- `tx.origin (address)`: sender of the transaction (full call chain)


## Xử lý Error
- `assert`
